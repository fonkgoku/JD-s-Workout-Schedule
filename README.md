# JD-s-Workout-Schedule
Justin Delugian's "Get Ripped In 3 Weeks" Workout Schedule.

## Workout

### Regimen

The workout should be started, first thing in the morning on an empty stomach. Taking a bowl of matcha, black coffee (no fat or other source of calories added) or your booster of choice beforehand is recommended.

> **Pro Tip:**
> Make sure you had a bowel movement before leaving the house, since the caffeine will accelerate your metabolism and might cause unexpected discomfort while working out.

### System

The workout consists of 4 day-types: Day A, Day B, Cardio and Rest. Abs are trained every day - even on rest days.

Muscle Group | Day A | Day B | Cardio | Rest
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Chest | ✖️ | | | |
Shoulder | ✖️ | | | |
Triceps | ✖️ | | | |
Back | | ✖️ | | |
Biceps | | ✖️ | |
Abs | ✖️ | ✖️ | ✖️ | ✖️
Legs | ✖️ | ✖️ | ✖️ | |

The day-types A and B are varied in terms of exercises every other day and therefore noted as A1/A2 and B1/B2 respectively. The days are spread out over the week like so:

Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday | Sunday
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Day A1 | Day B1 | Cardio | Day A2 | Day B2 | Cardio | Rest

### Exercises

This program is targeted towards Beginner to Intermediate, if you feel over- or underwhelmed you can decrease or increase the set count according to your fitness level. Ideally you should do every set to failure, meaning you should not be able to execute one more repetition.

> **Noob tip:** Exercises are noted in "Number of sets" (Integer) "times" (x) "Number of reps" (Number of repetitions)
